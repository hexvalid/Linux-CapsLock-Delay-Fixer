# Linux CapsLock Delay Fixer

**What is the capslock delay problem ?**
----------------------------------------
The problem occurs if you are used to typing capital letters using capslock button instead of shift and if you are writing too fast.
For example, you can see the same sentences in Linux;

> "HEllo my RAin. HOw are you today?"

There is a delay while switching to lowercase...
That problem occurs in every Linux-based operating system since years and it is still not fixed. I've tried different desktop computers, laptops, netbooks. Still same.

**But this script fixed this problem!**
**Usage**
-----
Add `bootstrap.sh` to your startup programs.
For Ubuntu:  `bash -ic "sh bootstrap.sh"`
